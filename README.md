# Epicenter

## Information
Epicenter takes place in a semi-post apocalyptic world. The island on which the game takes place had a severe virus outbreak the day before the start of the game, resulting in most of the citizens being turned into mindless zombies bent on eating human flesh. Fortunately, these zombies are averse to bright lights! Utilize your flashlight to deter zombies and flock to street lamps and other bright light sources to stay safe from the hoard! Use your various weapons and tools to collect the necessary supplies, contact the National Guard, and escape from the island! Be cautious, as zombies are very curious and will investigate noises such as loud footsteps, gunshots, thrown rocks, etc.

Below you will find a video demonstration of gameplay as well as screenshots that show off various menus and items within the game.
